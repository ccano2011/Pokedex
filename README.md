                "name": "static",
                "url": "https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/ability/9/"
            },

### MVP/PostMVP 

#### MVP 

- Implemment the API with proper endpoints for each section of the results (i.e. Species, Type, Bio/Info, Base Stat)
- Proper styling in the results page so the layout won't break between mobile and desktop views  
- Have a working "Random Pokemon" button that will select a new Pokemon at random from the homepage

#### PostMVP  

- Add background music
- Potentially add a button that will redirect users to Bulbopedia from the Results page
- Add a "landing page" for asthetic purposes
